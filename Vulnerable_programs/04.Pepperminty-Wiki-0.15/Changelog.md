## v0.14

### Changed
 - Improve the look of the downloader a bit. More work is needed here, apparently - I haven't touched it in _ages_!

## v0.14-beta1

### Added
 - Commenting! You'll need to update any custom themes you've created if you're including the commenting module in your build.
 - Added stacked bar to help you visualise what's taking up all the space in your wiki
 - Added link to edit master settings in the credits
 - Initial open search support!
     - After visiting your wiki once, you'll be able to press `<tab>` when typing the path to your wiki to perform a search.
     - It'll only work if your wiki is at the top-level of a domain without _anything_ after the `/` (subdomains are ok). This is a restriction of the protocol, not Pepperminty Wiki!
     - Supports sending search suggestions based on page names in the page index (based on case-insensitive leveshtein distance)
 - Avatars!
     - Gravatar is used if a user hasn't uploaded an avatar yet
     - An identicon is rendered if a user hasn't specified an email address or uploaded a gravatar yet either
     - Added `avatars_show` and `avatars_size` settings to control the displaying & size of rendered avatars.
     - Added the `avatar` action, which 307 redirects to the appropriate avatar image
 - Added `has_action` to make detecting enabled features easier (even if they move modules)
 - Edit previewing, thanks to @ikisler

### Changed
 - Updated MathJax CDN link, as cdn.mathjax.org is being retired ([source](https://www.mathjax.org/cdn-shutting-down/)).

### Fixed
 - Fixed error image generation in the image previewer under certain conditions.
 - Fixed warnings from being spewed all over the place under certain circumstances on the recent changes page
 - Fixed url encoding issue in redirects with ampersands in page names (#139)
 - Allow sending of OpenSearch description even when not logged in on wikis that require a login to work around some browser cookie issues
 - PR #135: Fix repeated page names on sidebar by @ikisler
 - PR #136: Fix issue where bottom nav is cut off by @ikisler

## v0.13
(No changes were made between the last beta release and this release)

## v0.13-beta2

### Added
 - Added new `query-searchindex` action to inspect the internals of the search engine
     - It returns the (ordered) search rankings as json, along with some additional debugging data

### Fixed
 - Clear the page id index out when rebuilding the search index from scratch.
     - This is needed to correct some issues where the id index goes all weird and assigns the same id to multiple pages
 - Don't search page titles or tags for stop words - it skews results since we don't search the page body for them


## v0.13-beta1

### Added
 - Added header to upload file page.
 - Added history support to the `raw` action.
 - Added 'smart save' to the page creator / editor. Nobody need ever loose edits ever again!
 - Added dynamic server-calculated page suggestions. Very helpful for larger wikis. Currently works best in firefox. Part of the `feature-search` module.
 - Added Alt + Enter support to the page search box. Works just like your browser's address bar - opens results in a new tab instead of the current one.
 - Initial UI for configuring settings! Some things still have to be done by editing the file, but it's certainly a start :D
 - User preferences!
     - Accessible via the (by default) small cog next to your username when you're logged in
     - The cog is customisable via the new `user_preferences_button_text` setting.
     - You can change your password
     - There's link to the master site settings from user preferences for admins.
 - [Module API] Added `$env->user_data` and `save_userdata()` to interact with the logged in users' data
 - User pages! Every page under `Users/` by default belongs to their respective users. e.g. `Users/admin` and all the pages under it belong to the `admin` user, so no other user can edit them.
     - You can access your own user page by clicking on your username in the top corner when you're logged in.
     - Added the `user_page_prefix` setting to allow customisation of where user pages should be located. Default value: `Users`
     - [Module API] Added `get_user_pagename()` and `extract_user_from_userpage()` to allow programmatic detection etc.
 - Added a `user-list` action that, well, outputs a list of users. Includes links to their respective user pages (though redlinks aren't implemented here yet).
 - Internal links like `[[Page name]]s` will now link to the correct page in include the rest of the word. Note that this functionality _can't_ be mixed with display text, like this: `[[Page name|Display text]]s` - the rest of the word will be silently ignored in the link!

### Changed
 - Overhauled internal history logic - history logic is now done in core.
 - Added `$env->page_filename`, which points to the current page on disk.
 - Changed the way different display modes are accessed. You can now use the new `mode` parameter to the `view` action. It supports 4 different modes at present: `normal`, `printable`, `contentonly`, and `parsedsourceonly`.
 - Improved recent changes links a bit.
 - Improved tabbing through the file upload form.
 - Changed the way users' data is stored to support arbitrary per-user data
 - Sorted list of registered actions on the dev help page
 - The page editor's main content box now automatically expands as you're typing! If you've got a custom theme, you may need to tweak it a bit. Help available on request.
 - Pages that are redirects how have their names appear in italics in search results.

### Fixed
 - The login session lifetime is now configurable (defaults to 24 hours), so you won't keep getting logged out all the time (in theory). (#113)
 - Recent changes made on different days are now displayed separately, as they should be (#112)
 - Always display footer message at the bottom of the page.
 - Trim the image url before short image url detection (#108)
 - Fixed huge issue with `contentonly` display mode.
 - Improved the search engine indexing algorithm. It now shouldn't choke on certain special characters (`[]{}|`) and will treat them as word boundaries.
 - Fixed tag links at the bottom of pages for tags with a single quote (`'`) in them.
 - Correct error message when attempting to move a page
 - Improved security of PHP session cookie by setting HttpOnly flag.
 - Linked pages with single quotes (`'`) in their names correctly in page lists.
 - Fixed blank descriptions in search results by defaulting to a snippet from the beginning of the page.
