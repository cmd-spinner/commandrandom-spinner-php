The CodeAnalyzer component contains classes to gather information about single
source files or a source tree.
This information are available for further processing as array structure.
Analyzed files aren't included in current process space. Instead they are
processed in a distinct process space.

To prevent execution of unsave code a custom php.ini is provided to the
sandboxed process disabling all unnecessary functions.

Furthermore, it provides a class loader which checks files for syntax errors and
includes all valid files.
This is used to get all necessary class/function definitions into a process
space to be able to reflect on them.

Important: The PHP5 interpreter has to be available via a 'php' call on the command line.
           On windows it has to be configured properly and added to the PATH var.

           The ezcBase Class MUST be available via
           include_once 'ezc/Base/base.php'; or include_once 'Base/base.php';
