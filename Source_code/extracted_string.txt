<h1>Can&#8217;t select database</h1>
<p>We were able to connect to the database server (which means your username and password is okay) but not able to select the <code>%1$s</code> database.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you sure it exists?</li>
<li>Does the user <code>%2$s</code> have permission to use the <code>%1$s</code> database?</li>
<li>On some systems the name of your database is prefixed with your username, so it would be like <code>username_%1$s</code>. Could that be the problem?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you don't know how to set up a database you should <strong>contact your host</strong>. If all else fails you may find help at the <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">WordPress Support Forums</a>.</p>

<strong>Featured Image</strong> - This allows you to associate an image with your post without inserting it. This is usually useful only if your theme makes use of the featured image as a post thumbnail on the home page, a custom header, etc.
<strong>Format</strong> - Post Formats designate how your theme will display a specific post. For example, you could have a <em>standard</em> blog post with a title and paragraphs, or a short <em>aside</em> that omits the title and contains a short text blurb. Please refer to the Codex for <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats#Supported_Formats">descriptions of each post format</a>. Your theme could enable all or some of 10 possible formats.
<strong>Important:</strong> before updating, please <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Backups">back up your database and files</a>. For help with updates, visit the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Updating_WordPress">Updating WordPress</a> Codex page.
<strong>Info</strong> - The domain and path are rarely edited as this can cause the site to not work properly. The Registered date and Last Updated date are displayed. Network admins can mark a site as archived, spam, deleted and mature, to remove from public listings or disable.
<strong>Name</strong> - The name is how it appears on your site.
<strong>Note:</strong><br />Deleting a category does not delete the posts in that category. Instead, posts that were only assigned to the deleted category are set to the category <strong>%s</strong>.
<strong>Order</strong> - Pages are usually ordered alphabetically, but you can choose your own order by entering a number (1 for first, etc.) in this field.
<strong>Parent</strong> - Categories, unlike tags, can have a hierarchy. You might have a Jazz category, and under that have child categories for Bebop and Big Band. Totally optional. To create a subcategory, just choose another category from the Parent dropdown.
<strong>Parent</strong> - You can arrange your pages in hierarchies. For example, you could have an &#8220;About&#8221; page that has &#8220;Life Story&#8221; and &#8220;My Dog&#8221; pages under it. There are no limits to how many levels you can nest pages.
<strong>Please Note:</strong> Any customizations you have made to theme files will be lost. Please consider using <a href="%s">child themes</a> for modifications.
<strong>Post editor</strong> - Enter the text for your post. There are two modes of editing: Visual and Text. Choose the mode by clicking on the appropriate tab. Visual mode gives you a WYSIWYG editor. Click the last icon in the row to get a second row of controls. The Text mode allows you to enter HTML along with your post text. Line breaks will be converted to paragraphs automatically. You can insert media files by clicking the icons above the post editor and following the directions. You can go to the distraction-free writing screen via the Fullscreen icon in Visual mode (second to last in the top row) or the Fullscreen button in Text mode (last in the row). Once there, you can make buttons visible by hovering over the top area. Exit Fullscreen back to the regular post editor.
<strong>Posted title:</strong> %s
<strong>Preview</strong> will show you what your draft post will look like if you publish it. View will take you to your live site to view the post. Which link is available depends on your post&#8217;s status.
<strong>Publish</strong> - You can set the terms of publishing your post in the Publish box. For Status, Visibility, and Publish (immediately), click on the Edit link to reveal more options. Visibility includes options for password-protecting a post or making it stay at the top of your blog indefinitely (sticky). Publish (immediately) allows you to set a future or past date and time, so you can schedule a post to be published in the future or backdate a post.
<strong>Quick Draft</strong> - Allows you to create a new post and save it as a draft. Also displays links to the 5 most recent draft posts you've started.
<strong>Quick Edit</strong> provides inline access to the metadata of your post, allowing you to update post details without leaving this screen.
<strong>RSS Error</strong>: %s
<strong>Random:</strong> Show a different image on each page.
<strong>Screen Options</strong> - Use the Screen Options tab to choose which Dashboard boxes to show.
<strong>Send Trackbacks</strong> - Trackbacks are a way to notify legacy blog systems that you&#8217;ve linked to them. Enter the URL(s) you want to send trackbacks. If you link to other WordPress sites they&#8217;ll be notified automatically using pingbacks, and this field is unnecessary.
<strong>Settings</strong> - This page shows a list of all settings associated with this site. Some are created by WordPress and others are created by plugins you activate. Note that some fields are grayed out and say Serialized Data. You cannot modify these values due to the way the setting is stored in the database.
<strong>Slug</strong> - The &#8220;slug&#8221; is the URL-friendly version of the name. It is usually all lowercase and contains only letters, numbers, and hyphens.
<strong>Template</strong> - Some themes have custom templates you can use for certain pages that might have additional features or custom layouts. If so, you&#8217;ll see them in this dropdown menu.
<strong>The parent theme could not be found.</strong> You will need to install the parent theme, <strong>%s</strong>, before you can use this child theme.
<strong>Themes and Plugins</strong> &mdash; To update individual themes or plugins from this screen, use the checkboxes to make your selection, then <strong>click on the appropriate &#8220;Update&#8221; button</strong>. To update all of your themes or plugins at once, you can check the box at the top of the section to select all before clicking the update button.
<strong>Themes</strong> - This area shows themes that are not already enabled across the network. Enabling a theme in this menu makes it accessible to this site. It does not activate the theme, but allows it to show in the site&#8217;s Appearance menu. To enable a theme for the entire network, see the <a href="%s">Network Themes</a> screen.
<strong>Title</strong> - Enter a title for your post. After you enter a title, you&#8217;ll see the permalink below, which you can edit.
<strong>Translations</strong> &mdash; The files translating WordPress into your language are updated for you whenever any other updates occur. But if these files are out of date, you can <strong>click the &#8220;Update Translations&#8221;</strong> button.
<strong>Trash</strong> removes your post from this list and places it in the trash, from which you can permanently delete it.
<strong>Users</strong> - This displays the users associated with this site. You can also change their role, reset their password, or remove them from the site. Removing the user from the site does not remove the user from the network.

Because this is a multisite installation, you may add accounts that already exist on the Network by specifying a username or email, and defining a role. For more options, such as specifying a password, you have to be a Network Administrator and use the hover link under an existing user&#8217;s name to Edit the user profile under Network Admin > All Users.
Because you are using <code>localhost</code>, the sites in your WordPress network must use sub-directories. Consider using <code>localhost.localdomain</code> if you wish to use sub-domains.
Because your install is in a directory, the sites in your WordPress network must use sub-directories.
Because your install is not new, the sites in your WordPress network must use sub-domains.

Before you can upload your import file, you will need to fix the following error:
Begin by choosing a theme to edit from the dropdown menu and clicking Select. A list then appears of all the template files. Clicking once on any file name causes the file to appear in the large Editor box.
Below you should enter your database connection details. If you&#8217;re not sure about these, contact your host.

Categories and Tags Converter
Categories can be selectively converted to tags using the <a href="%s">category to tag converter</a>.
Categories have hierarchy, meaning that you can nest sub-categories. Tags do not have hierarchy and cannot be nested. Sometimes people start out using one on their posts, then later realize that the other would work better for their content.
Categories, unlike tags, can have a hierarchy. You might have a Jazz category, and under that have children categories for Bebop and Big Band. Totally optional.

Creating a Page is very similar to creating a Post, and the screens can be customized in the same way using drag and drop, the Screen Options tab, and expanding/collapsing boxes as you choose. This screen also has the distraction-free writing space, available in both the Visual and Text modes via the Fullscreen buttons. The Page editor mostly works the same as the Post editor, but there are some Page-specific features in the Page Attributes box:

Identify a hook in progress with <code>doing_action()</code> and <code>doing_filter()</code>, and manipulate custom image sizes with <code>has_image_size()</code> and <code>remove_image_size()</code>.
If <code>mod_rewrite</code> is disabled, ask your administrator to enable that module, or look at the <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/mod/mod_rewrite.html">Apache documentation</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=apache+mod_rewrite">elsewhere</a> for help setting it up.
If a media file has not been attached to any post, you will see that in the Attached To column, and can click on Attach File to launch a small popup that will allow you to search for a post and attach the file.
If a version update to core has not happened, clicking this button won&#8217;t affect anything.
If an update is available, you&#8127;ll see a notification appear in the Toolbar and navigation menu.
If desired, WordPress will automatically alert various services of your new posts.
If for any reason this automatic file creation doesn&#8217;t work, don&#8217;t worry. All this does is fill in the database information to a configuration file. You may also simply open <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> in a text editor, fill in your information, and save it as <code>wp-config.php</code>.
If registration is disabled, please set <code>NOBLOGREDIRECT</code> in <code>wp-config.php</code> to a URL you will redirect visitors to if they visit a non-existent site.
If something goes wrong with a plugin and you can&#8217;t use WordPress, delete or rename that file in the <code>%s</code> directory and it will be automatically deactivated.
If the admin email for the new site does not exist in the database, a new user will also be created.
If the importer you need is not listed, <a href="%s">search the plugin directory</a> to see if an importer is available.
If the link is to a person, you can specify your relationship with them using the above form. If you would like to learn more about the idea check out <a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/">XFN</a>.
If the network admin disables a theme that is in use, it can still remain selected on that site. If another theme is chosen, the disabled theme will not appear in the site&#8217;s Appearance > Themes screen.
If the root directory of your site were <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">writable</a>, we could do this automatically, but it isn&#8217;t so this is the url rewrite rule you should have in your <code>web.config</code> file. Create a new file, called <code>web.config</code> in the root directory of your site. Click in the field and press <kbd>CTRL + a</kbd> to select all. Then insert this code into the <code>web.config</code> file.
If this process fails for any reason, users logging in to their sites will force the same update.
If this was a mistake, just ignore this email and nothing will happen.

If you are looking to use the link manager, please install the <a href="%s">Link Manager</a> plugin.
If you are the owner of this network please check that MySQL is running properly and all tables are error free.
If you delete a link, it will be removed permanently, as Links do not have a Trash function yet.
If you do not activate your site within two days, you will have to sign up again.
If you do not activate your username within two days, you will have to sign up again.
If you do not remember your credentials, you should contact your web host.
If you do not want to use your %s site any more, you can delete it using the form below. When you click <strong>Delete My Site Permanently</strong> you will be sent an email with a link in it. Click on this link to delete your site.
If you don&#8217;t want a header image to be displayed on your site at all, click the &#8220;Remove Header Image&#8221; button at the bottom of the Header Image section of this page. If you want to re-enable the header image later, you just have to select one of the other image options and click &#8220;Save Changes&#8221;.
If you don&lsquo;t want to upload your own image, you can use one of these cool headers, or show a random one.
If you experience any issues or need support, the volunteers in the WordPress.org support forums may be able to help.
If you have a plugin in a .zip format, you may install it by uploading it here.
If you have a theme in a .zip format, you may install it by uploading it here.
If you have marked plugins as favorites on WordPress.org, you can browse them here.
If you have posts or comments in another system, WordPress can import those into this site. To get started, choose a system to import from below:
If you haven&#8217;t received your email yet, there are a number of things you can do:
If you haven&#8217;t yet created any menus, <strong>click the &#8217;create a new menu&#8217; link</strong> to get started
If you just want to get an idea of what&#8217;s available, you can browse Featured, Popular, and Newest plugins by using the links in the upper left of the screen. These sections rotate regularly.
If you know what you&#8217;re looking for, Search is your best bet. The Search screen has options to search the WordPress.org Plugin Directory for a particular Term, Author, or Tag. You can also search the directory by selecting popular tags. Tags in larger type mean more plugins have been labeled with that tag.
If you like, you may enter custom structures for your category and tag <abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s here. For example, using <code>topics</code> as your category base would make your category links like <code>http://example.org/%stopics/uncategorized/</code>. If you leave these blank the defaults will be used.
If you need to re-install version %s, you can do so here or download the package and re-install manually:
If you pick an option other than Default, your general URL path with structure tags, terms surrounded by <code>%</code>, will also appear in the custom structure field and your path can be further modified there.
If you reach out to us, we'll also ensure you'll never have this problem again.
If you reached this screen by accident and meant to visit one of your own sites, here are some shortcuts to help you find your way.
If you take over, %s will be blocked from continuing to edit.
If you temporarily make your <code>web.config</code> file writable for us to generate rewrite rules automatically, do not forget to revert the permissions after rule has been saved.
If you temporarily make your site&#8217;s root directory writable for us to generate the <code>web.config</code> file automatically, do not forget to revert the permissions after the file has been created.
If you want site visitors to be able to register themselves, as opposed to by the site administrator, check the membership box. A default user role can be set for all new users, whether self-registered or registered by the site admin.
If you want to ban domains from site registrations. One domain per line.
If you want to convert your categories to tags (or vice versa), use the <a href="%s">Categories and Tags Converter</a> available from the Import screen.
If you want to install a plugin that you&#8217;ve downloaded elsewhere, click the Upload link in the upper left. You will be prompted to upload the .zip package, and once uploaded, you can activate the new plugin.
If you want to limit site registrations to certain domains. One domain per line.
If you want to make changes but don&#8217;t want them to be overwritten when the plugin is updated, you may be ready to think about writing your own plugin. For information on how to edit plugins, write your own from scratch, or just better understand their anatomy, check out the links below.
If you want to remove the widget but save its setting for possible future use, just drag it into the Inactive Widgets area. You can add them back anytime from there. This is especially helpful when you switch to a theme with fewer or different widget areas.
If you want to run multiple WordPress installations in a single database, change this.
If you would like to change the password type a new one. Otherwise leave this blank.
If you would like to see more themes to choose from, click on the &#8220;Add New&#8221; button and you will be able to browse or search for additional themes from the <a href="%s" target="_blank">WordPress.org Theme Directory</a>. Themes in the WordPress.org Theme Directory are designed and developed by third parties, and are compatible with the license WordPress uses. Oh, and they&#8217;re free!
If you would like to use Akismet on more than 10 sites, you will need to <a href="%s" target="_blank">upgrade to an Enterprise subscription</a>. If you have any questions, please <a href="%s" target="_blank">get in touch with our support team</a>
If you&#8217;re looking to paste rich content from Microsoft Word, try turning this option off. The editor will clean up text pasted from Word automatically.
If you&#8217;re not going to use a great site domain, leave it for a new user. Now have at it!
If you&#8217;re still stuck with this message, then check that your database contains the following tables:
If your <code>.htaccess</code> file were <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">writable</a>, we could do this automatically, but it isn&#8217;t so these are the mod_rewrite rules you should have in your <code>.htaccess</code> file. Click in the field and press <kbd>CTRL + a</kbd> to select all.
If your <code>web.config</code> file were <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Changing_File_Permissions">writable</a>, we could do this automatically, but it isn&#8217;t so this is the url rewrite rule you should have in your <code>web.config</code> file. Click in the field and press <kbd>CTRL + a</kbd> to select all. Then insert this rule inside of the <code>/&lt;configuration&gt;/&lt;system.webServer&gt;/&lt;rewrite&gt;/&lt;rules&gt;</code> element in <code>web.config</code> file.
If your bookmarks toolbar is hidden: copy the code below, open your Bookmarks manager, create new bookmark, type Press This into the name field and paste the code into the URL field.
If your browser doesn&#8217;t start loading the next page automatically, click this link:
If your site does not display, please contact the owner of this network.
If your theme has more than one default header image, or you have uploaded more than one custom header image, you have the option of having WordPress display a randomly different image on each page of your site. Click the &#8220;Random&#8221; radio button next to the Uploaded Images or Default Images section to enable this feature.

In Response To
In a few words, explain what this site is about.
In all likelihood, these items were supplied to you by your Web Host. If you do not have this information, then you will need to contact them before you can continue. If you&#8217;re all ready&hellip;
In most cases, WordPress will automatically apply maintenance and security updates in the background for you.
In previous versions of WordPress, all importers were built-in. They have been turned into plugins since most people only use them once or infrequently.
In reply to <a href="%1$s">%2$s</a>.
In the <strong>Author</strong> column, in addition to the author&#8217;s name, email address, and blog URL, the commenter&#8217;s IP address is shown. Clicking on this link will show you all the comments made from this IP address.
In the <strong>Comment</strong> column, above each comment it says &#8220;Submitted on,&#8221; followed by the date and time the comment was left on your site. Clicking on the date/time link will take you to that comment on your live site. Hovering over any comment gives you options to approve, reply (and approve), quick edit, edit, spam mark, or trash that comment.
In the <strong>In Response To</strong> column, there are three elements. The text is the name of the post that inspired the comment, and links to the post editor for that entry. The View Post link leads to that post on your live site. The small bubble with the number in it shows the number of approved comments that post has received. If the bubble is gray, you have moderated all comments for that post. If it is blue, there are pending comments. Clicking the bubble will filter the comments screen to show only comments on that post.
In the Header Text section of this page, you can choose whether to display this text or hide it. You can also choose a color for the text by clicking the Select Color button and either typing in a legitimate HTML hex value, e.g. &#8220;#ff0000&#8221; for red, or by choosing a color using the color picker.
In the editing area the Tab key enters a tab character. To move below this area by pressing Tab, press the Esc key followed by the Tab key.

Many people choose to use &#8220;pretty permalinks,&#8221; URLs that contain useful information such as the post title rather than generic post ID numbers. You can choose from any of the permalink formats under Common Settings, or can craft your own if you select Custom Structure.
Many people take advantage of keyboard shortcuts to moderate their comments more quickly. Use the link to the side to learn more.
Many themes show some sidebar widgets by default until you edit your sidebars, but they are not automatically displayed in your sidebar management tool. After you make your first widget change, you can re-add the default widgets by adding them from the Available Widgets area.

Menu setting enables/disables the plugin menus from appearing for non super admins, so that only super admins, not site admins, have access to activate plugins.
Menus can be displayed in locations defined by your theme, even used in sidebars by adding a &#8220;Custom Menu&#8221; widget on the <a href="%1$s">Widgets</a> screen. If your theme does not support the custom menus feature (the default themes, %2$s and %3$s, do), you can learn about adding this support by following the Documentation link to the side.

Most of the time, plugins play nicely with the core of WordPress and with other plugins. Sometimes, though, a plugin&#8217;s code will get in the way of another plugin, causing compatibility issues. If your site starts doing strange things, this may be the problem. Try deactivating all your plugins and re-activating them in various combinations until you isolate which one(s) caused the issue.
Most themes display the site title at the top of every page, in the title bar of the browser, and as the identifying name for syndicated feeds. The tagline is also displayed by many themes.

Pages are similar to Posts in that they have a title, body text, and associated metadata, but they are different in that they are not part of the chronological blog stream, kind of like permanent posts. Pages are not categorized or tagged, but can have a hierarchy. You can nest Pages under other Pages by making one the &#8220;Parent&#8221; of the other, creating a group of Pages.

Post via email settings allow you to send your WordPress install an email with the content of your post. You must set up a secret e-mail account with POP3 access to use this, and any mail received at this address will be posted, so it&#8217;s a good idea to keep this address very secret.

This is an example page. It's different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:

<blockquote>Hi there! I'm a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my blog. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like pi&#241;a coladas. (And gettin' caught in the rain.)</blockquote>

...or something like this:

<blockquote>The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.</blockquote>

What&#8217;s the difference between categories and tags? Normally, tags are ad-hoc keywords that identify important information in your post (names, subjects, etc) that may or may not recur in other posts, while categories are pre-determined sections. If you think of your site like a book, the categories are like the Table of Contents and the tags are like the terms in the index.
When a comment contains any of these words in its content, name, URL, e-mail, or IP, it will be held in the <a href="edit-comments.php?comment_status=moderated">moderation queue</a>. One word or IP per line. It will match inside words, so &#8220;press&#8221; will match &#8220;WordPress&#8221;.
When a comment contains any of these words in its content, name, URL, e-mail, or IP, it will be marked as spam. One word or IP per line. It will match inside words, so &#8220;press&#8221; will match &#8220;WordPress&#8221;.
When adding a new category on this screen, you&#8217;ll fill in the following fields:
When adding a new tag on this screen, you&#8217;ll fill in the following fields:
When changing themes, there is often some variation in the number and setup of widget areas/sidebars and sometimes these conflicts make the transition a bit less smooth. If you changed themes and seem to be missing widgets, scroll down on this screen to the Inactive Widgets area, where all of your widgets and their settings will have been saved.
When previewing on smaller monitors, you can use the collapse icon at the bottom of the left-hand pane. This will hide the pane, giving you more room to preview your site in the new theme. To bring the pane back, click on the collapse icon again.
When this setting is in effect, a reminder is shown in the At a Glance box of the Dashboard that says, &#8220;Search Engines Discouraged,&#8221; to remind you that your site is not being crawled.
When using Bulk Edit, you can change the metadata (categories, author, etc.) for all selected posts at once. To remove a post from the grouping, just click the x next to its name in the Bulk Edit area that appears.
When you assign multiple categories or tags to a post, only one can show up in the permalink: the lowest numbered category. This applies if your custom structure includes <code>%category%</code> or <code>%tag%</code>.
When you click the button below WordPress will create an XML file for you to save to your computer.
When you publish a new post, WordPress automatically notifies the following site update services. For more about this, see <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Update_Services">Update Services</a> on the Codex. Separate multiple service <abbr title="Universal Resource Locator">URL</abbr>s with line breaks.
Which columns in the activities table do you wish to see?

Whoops, the provided date is invalid.
Widgets are independent sections of content that can be placed into any widgetized area provided by your theme (commonly called sidebars). To populate your sidebars/widget areas with individual widgets, drag and drop the title bars into the desired area. By default, only the first widget area is expanded. To populate additional widget areas, click on their title bars to expand them.
Widgets may be used multiple times. You can give each widget a title, to display on your site, but it&#8217;s not required.

With quicker access to crop and rotation tools, it&#8217;s now much easier to edit your images while editing posts. You can also scale images directly in the editor to find just the right fit.

You can Search for themes by keyword, author, or tag, or can get more specific and search by criteria listed in the feature filter. Alternately, you can browse the themes that are Featured, Newest, or Recently Updated. When you find a theme you like, you can preview it or install it.
You can Upload a theme manually if you have already downloaded its ZIP archive onto your computer (make sure it is from a trusted and original source). You can also do it the old-fashioned way and copy a downloaded theme&#8217;s folder via FTP into your <code>/wp-content/themes</code> directory.
You can add links here to be displayed on your site, usually using <a href="%s">Widgets</a>. By default, links to several sites in the WordPress community are included as examples.
You can add or edit links on this screen by entering information in each of the boxes. Only the link&#8217;s web address and name (the text you want to display on your site as the link) are required fields.
You can also browse a user&#8217;s favorite plugins, by using the Favorites link in the upper left of the screen and entering their WordPress.org username.
You can also choose a background color by clicking the Select Color button and either typing in a legitimate HTML hex value, e.g. &#8220;#ff0000&#8221; for red, or by choosing a color using the color picker.
You can also control the display of your content in RSS feeds, including the maximum numbers of posts to display and whether to show full text or a summary.
You can also create posts with the <a href="%s">Press This bookmarklet</a>.
You can also edit or move multiple posts to the trash at once. Select the posts you want to act on using the checkboxes, then select the action you want to take from the Bulk Actions menu and click Apply.
You can also embed media from many popular websites including Twitter, YouTube, Flickr and others by pasting the media URL on its own line into the content of your post/page. Please refer to the Codex to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">learn more about embeds</a>.
You can also go to the user&#8217;s profile page by clicking on the individual username.
You can also moderate the comment from this screen using the Status box, where you can also change the timestamp of the comment.
You can also perform the same types of actions, including narrowing the list by using the filters, acting on a page using the action links that appear when you hover over a row, or using the Bulk Actions menu to edit the metadata for multiple pages at once.
You can assign keywords to your posts using <strong>tags</strong>. Unlike categories, tags have no hierarchy, meaning there&#8217;s no relationship from one tag to another.
You can assign theme locations to individual menus by <strong>selecting the desired settings</strong> at the bottom of the menu editor. To assign menus to all theme locations at once, <strong>visit the Manage Locations tab</strong> at the top of the screen.
You can change the display of this screen using the Screen Options tab to set how many items are displayed per screen and to display/hide columns in the table.
You can change your password, turn on keyboard shortcuts, change the color scheme of your WordPress administration screens, and turn off the WYSIWYG (Visual) editor, among other things. You can hide the Toolbar (formerly called the Admin Bar) from the front end of your site, however it cannot be disabled on the admin screens.
You can choose from the theme&#8217;s default header images, or use one of your own. You can also customize how your Site Title and Tagline are displayed.
You can choose one of your previously uploaded headers, or show a random one.
You can choose what&#8217;s displayed on the front page of your site. It can be posts in reverse chronological order (classic blog), or a fixed/static page. To set a static home page, you first need to create two <a href="%s">Pages</a>. One will become the front page, and the other will be where your posts are displayed.
You can choose whether or not your site will be crawled by robots, ping services, and spiders. If you want those services to ignore your site, click the checkbox next to &#8220;Discourage search engines from indexing this site&#8221; and click the Save Changes button at the bottom of the screen. Note that your privacy is not complete; your site is still visible on the web.
You can create a <code>wp-config.php</code> file through a web interface, but this doesn't work for all server setups. The safest way is to manually create the file.
You can create groups of links by using Link Categories. Link Category names must be unique and Link Categories are separate from the categories you use for posts.
You can create the <code>wp-config.php</code> manually and paste the following text into it.
You can customize the display of this screen in a number of ways:
You can customize the display of this screen using the Screen Options tab and/or the dropdown filters above the links table.
You can customize the display of this screen&#8217;s contents in a number of ways:
You can customize the look of your site without touching any of your theme&#8217;s code by using a custom background. Your background can be an image or a color.
You can delete Link Categories in the Bulk Action pull-down, but that action does not delete the links within the category. Instead, it moves them to the default Link Category.
You can edit the image while preserving the thumbnail. For example, you may wish to have a square thumbnail that displays just a section of the image.
You can edit the information left in a comment if needed. This is often useful when you notice that a commenter has made a typographical error.
You can edit your menu content on the Menus screen in the Appearance section.
You can export a file of your site&#8217;s content in order to import it into another installation or platform. The export file will be an XML file format called WXR. Posts, pages, comments, custom fields, categories, and tags can be included. You can choose for the WXR file to include only certain posts or pages by setting the dropdown filters to limit the export by category, author, date range by month, or publishing status.
You can filter the list of posts by post status using the text links in the upper left to show All, Published, Draft, or Trashed posts. The default view is to show all posts.
You can filter the list of users by User Role using the text links in the upper left to show All, Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, or Subscriber. The default view is to show all users. Unused User Roles are not listed.
You can find additional plugins for your site by using the <a href="%1$s">Plugin Browser/Installer</a> functionality or by browsing the <a href="%2$s" target="_blank">WordPress Plugin Directory</a> directly and installing new plugins manually. To manually install a plugin you generally just need to upload the plugin file into your <code>/wp-content/plugins</code> directory. Once a plugin has been installed, you can activate it here.
You can find additional themes for your site by using the Theme Browser/Installer on this screen, which will display themes from the <a href="%s" target="_blank">WordPress.org Theme Directory</a>. These themes are designed and developed by third parties, are available free of charge, and are compatible with the license WordPress uses.
You can help us fight spam and upgrade your account by <a href="%s" target="_blank">contributing a token amount</a>.
You can hide/display columns based on your needs and decide how many posts to list per screen using the Screen Options tab.
You can hide/display columns based on your needs and decide how many users to list per screen using the Screen Options tab.
You can make an existing user an additional super admin by going to the Edit User profile page and checking the box to grant that privilege.
You can manage comments made on your site similar to the way you manage posts and other content. This screen is customizable in the same ways as other management screens, and you can act on comments using the on-hover action links or the Bulk Actions.
You can narrow the list by file type/status using the text link filters at the top of the screen. You also can refine the list by date using the dropdown menu above the media table.
You can paste into the visual editor from your word processor without wasting time to clean up messy styling. (Yeah, we&#8217;re talking about you, Microsoft Word.)
You can proportionally scale the original image. For best results, scaling should be done before you crop, flip, or rotate. Images can only be scaled down, not up.
You can refine the list to show only posts in a specific category or from a specific month by using the dropdown menus above the posts list. Click the Filter button after making your selection. You also can refine the list by clicking on the post author, category or tag in the posts list.
You can see all comments on this post here: 
You can see all pingbacks on this post here: 
You can see all trackbacks on this post here: 
You can select an image to be shown at the top of your site by uploading from your computer or choosing from your media library. After selecting an image you will be able to crop it.
You can set a custom image header for your site. Simply upload the image and crop it, and the new header will go live immediately. Alternatively, you can use an image that has already been uploaded to your Media Library by clicking the &#8220;Choose Image&#8221; button.
You can set maximum sizes for images inserted into your written content; you can also insert an image as Full Size.
You can sort the table by clicking on any of the bold headings and switch between list and excerpt views by using the icons in the upper right.
You can still use your site but any subdomain you create may not be accessible. If you know your DNS is correct, ignore this message.
You can submit content in several different ways; this screen holds the settings for all of them. The top section controls the editor within the dashboard, while the rest control external publishing methods. For more information on any of these methods, use the documentation links.
You can update to <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_%1$s">WordPress %2$s</a> automatically or download the package and install it manually:
You can upload and insert media (images, audio, documents, etc.) by clicking the Add Media button. You can select from the images and files already uploaded to the Media Library, or upload new media to add to your page or post. To create an image gallery, select the images to add and click the &#8220;Create a new gallery&#8221; button.
You can upload media files here without creating a post first. This allows you to upload files to use with posts and pages later and/or to get a web link for a particular file that you can share. There are three options for uploading files:
You can use categories to define sections of your site and group related posts. The default category is &#8220;Uncategorized&#8221; until you change it in your <a href="%s">writing settings</a>.
You can use one of these cool headers or show a random one on each page.
You can use the Theme Editor to edit the individual CSS and PHP files which make up your theme.
You can use the editor to make changes to any of your plugins&#8217; individual PHP files. Be aware that if you make changes, plugins updates will overwrite your customizations.
You can use the following controls to arrange your Dashboard screen to suit your workflow. This is true on most other administration screens as well.
You can view all posts made by a user by clicking on the number under the Posts column.
You can view posts in a simple title list or with an excerpt. Choose the view you prefer by clicking on the icons at the top of the list on the right.
